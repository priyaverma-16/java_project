        /*Java Setup Learn (JDK,
      - Compilation> When we write a java program, we save it in a ".java file", which contains human readable source code
            to run it the java compiler javac translate or compile that code into bytecode which store in ".class file". this
            bytecode isn't specific to any operating system. Then the JVM take over the JVM reads that bytecode and either
            interprets it or compiles it "just-in-time JIT" into native machine code, depending on what most efficient. and this
            process make java plateform independent meaning write once and run anywhere, the JVM is installed
      -Java Entities->
           >CLASS -> A class is fundamental building block of object Oriented programming language. it is user defined datatype.
                which act as a blueprint for creating the object and encapsulated with field and behavior.

           >VARIABLES -> Variables are used to store data values and there are different types, based on how and where
                they are declared. Local Variables inside method, Instance variables for each object, and static variables
                shared across all instance of class. each variable must have data type.

           >METHOD -> Method is a reusable block of code that can be invoked as many times. it is defined inside a Class
                Key Component :- Access Modifier, Return type, Method name, parameters, method body.

           >DATA TYPES -> it defines what kind of value a variable can hold and how much memory that variable occupied
           it basically help compiler to under how to handle that datatype during execution time
           in java there are two type of datatype

           Primitive Type -> # Store in Stack memory # can not be null # always have default value 0 or false
                             # cannot call method directly
                  Whole Numbers :
                               Byte -1byte-> (Hold small whole numbers from  -128 - 127
                               Short -2byte-> ( Stores -32768 to 32767)
                               int -4byte-> (commonly use datatype in java stores -2 billion to 2 billion)
                               long -8byte-> (store upto 9 quintillion with L at the end)
                               float - 4byte -> (store decimal upto 7 digits follow by adding F at the end)
                               double - 8byte -> (store decimal upto 16 digits )
                               ------------------------------------------
                               Boolean -> hold Tru and False
                               Char -> hold single character 'A'

          Non Primitive - > known as reference datatype as well # Store in heap Memory # can be null #Default value can
                            be null # can invoke methods
                               String -> stores text
                               Array -> stores multiple value into single variable
                               user define classes -> use as a blueprint for creating object
                               Interfaces
