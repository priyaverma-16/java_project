        /*Java Setup Learn (JDK,
      - Compilation> When we write a java program, we save it in a ".java file", which contains human readable source code
            to run it the java compiler javac translate or compile that code into bytecode which store in ".class file". this
            bytecode isn't specific to any operating system. Then the JVM take over the JVM reads that bytecode and either
            interprets it or compiles it "just-in-time JIT" into native machine code, depending on what most efficient. and this
            process make java plateform independent meaning write once and run anywhere, the JVM is installed

           >CLASS -> A class is fundamental building block of object Oriented programming language. it is user defined datatype.
                which act as a blueprint for creating the object and encapsulated with field and behavior.

           >VARIABLES -> Variables are used to store data values and there are different types, based on how and where
                they are declared. Local Variables inside method, Instance variables for each object, and static variables
                shared across all instance of class. each variable must have data type.

           >METHOD -> Method is a reusable block of code that can invoke as many times. it is defined inside a Class
                Key Component :- Access Modifier, Return type, Method name, parameters, method body.
